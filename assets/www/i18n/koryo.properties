precogCardDetailMessage=The power of the &quot;Omniscient&quot; is permanent. In case of a tie for the majority on any given family, the player controlling the &quot;Omniscient&quot; wins the tie and may use the corresponding power. So, if 3 players have 2 &quot;Guardians&quot; in play, but one also controls the &quot;Omniscient&quot;, then he is the one protected from the &quot;Barbarian&quot; event. Not the others. <b>WARNING</b>: This power does not break ties for scoring Influence Points during the final scoring phase. It is applicable only during the rounds.
