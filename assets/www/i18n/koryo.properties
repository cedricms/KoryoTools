precogCardQuantityMessage=1
precogCardDetailMessage=The power of the &quot;Omniscient&quot; is permanent. In case of a tie for the majority on any given family, the player controlling the &quot;Omniscient&quot; wins the tie and may use the corresponding power. So, if 3 players have 2 &quot;Guardians&quot; in play, but one also controls the &quot;Omniscient&quot;, then he is the one protected from the &quot;Barbarian&quot; event. Not the others.<br/><br/><b>WARNING</b>: This power does not break ties for scoring Influence Points during the final scoring phase. It is applicable only during the rounds.

espionCardQuantityMessage=2
espionCardDetailMessage=The &quot;Spies&quot; have two distinct powers, each one requiring some conditions to be met in order to be available (in addition to the normal &quot;majority&quot; condition).<br/><br/><i>Power 1:</i> During his turn, if a player has the majority of &quot;Spies&quot;, he may steal a &quot;Victory Point&quot; token from another player (not from the Bank!). Note: If no player has a token, this power is inoperative.<br/><br/><i>Power 2:</i> The &quot;Spies&quot; also protect against the &quot;Lobbying&quot; events (like the &quot;Guardians&quot; against the &quot;Barbarians&quot;). BUT this protection is not available if the player has at least one &quot;Guardian&quot; (#7) in play. No majority is needed, just one &quot;Guardian&quot;! When so protected, the player may not be targeted by any &quot;Lobbying&quot; event, even if he is the one playing it. Hence, in a 3-4 player game, the player having the majority of &quot;Spies&quot; and playing a &quot;Lobbying&quot; event must target 2 different opponent players.
