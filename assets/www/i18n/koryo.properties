precogCardQuantityMessage=1
precogCardDetailMessage=The power of the &quot;Omniscient&quot; is permanent. In case of a tie for the majority on any given family, the player controlling the &quot;Omniscient&quot; wins the tie and may use the corresponding power. So, if 3 players have 2 <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="gardienLink">&quot;Guardians&quot;</a> in play, but one also controls the &quot;Omniscient&quot;, then he is the one protected from the <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="barbaresLink">&quot;Barbarian&quot;</a> event. Not the others.<br/><br/><b>WARNING</b>: This power does not break ties for scoring Influence Points during the final scoring phase. It is applicable only during the rounds.

espionCardQuantityMessage=2
espionCardDetailMessage=The <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="espionLink">&quot;Spies&quot;</a> have two distinct powers, each one requiring some conditions to be met in order to be available (in addition to the normal &quot;majority&quot; condition).<br/><br/><i>Power 1:</i> During his turn, if a player has the majority of <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="espionLink">&quot;Spies&quot;</a>, he may steal a &quot;Victory Point&quot; token from another player (not from the Bank!). Note: If no player has a token, this power is inoperative.<br/><br/><i>Power 2:</i> The <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="espionLink">&quot;Spies&quot;</a> also protect against the <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="lobbyingLink">&quot;Lobbying&quot;</a> events (like the <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="gardienLink">&quot;Guardians&quot;</a> against the <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="barbaresLink">&quot;Barbarians&quot;</a>). BUT this protection is not available if the player has at least one <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="gardienLink">&quot;Guardian&quot;</a> (#7) in play. No majority is needed, just one <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="gardienLink">&quot;Guardian&quot;</a>! When so protected, the player may not be targeted by any <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="lobbyingLink">&quot;Lobbying&quot;</a> event, even if he is the one playing it. Hence, in a 3-4 player game, the player having the majority of <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="espionLink">&quot;Spies&quot;</a> and playing a <a href="#" data-toggle="tab" class="lobbyingLink">&quot;Lobbying&quot;</a> event must target 2 different opponent players.

banquierCardDetailMessage=If a player has the majority of &quot;Bankers&quot; during his turn, he may take a &quot;Victory Point&quot; token. But be careful! There are only 8 such tokens in play. So, when none is left, the Bank is empty and the power of the &quot;Banker&quot; becomes ineffective.

He is protected against anyone willing to destroy one of his &quot;Character&quot; cards.
